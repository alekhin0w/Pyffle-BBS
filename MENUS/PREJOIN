The JOIN command allows you to configure your NEW scan.
If you want to have Usenet newsgroups appear, use JOIN to
add them to (or remove them from) your NEW scan.

Usenet newsgroups vary in their traffic; some will have zero
new messages daily whereas others may have over 100. Use
caution or you may fall behind..
