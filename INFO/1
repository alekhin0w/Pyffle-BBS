Welcome the B4BBS/waffle - keeping UUCP going into the 21st century.

This is a data communications symposium in which communications
hobbyists (otherwise known as geeks) congregate and send silly messages
to each other, and read further information about it (like this)
all of which is completely useless and irrelevant to the scheme of
things in general.

Thank you for listening.
