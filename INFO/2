
* System Information...

[This was too funny to modify.. -ed ]

Since the authors of this software are not entirely sure what kind of
hardware this system is running on, we will give it our best guess.

This system, whatever it may be called, is most likely running Waffle
either on a Unix box or an IBM PC with MS DOS. It has a hard disk which
most certainly is 20 MB or larger. No doubt the modem is at least 2400b.

We do know that the software running here is Waffle. If you are reading
this, it likely has not been installed very thoroughly. If there are
cows in the main menu, or (worse) Sid Vicious quotes, then it definitely
has not been installed thoroughly. Please bug the SYSTEM 0PERATOR.

The system is probably 24 hours, and may be down occasionally because
of hardware problems, war, earthquakes, or other natural disasters.

An easy way to contact the SYSTEM 0PERATOR is to send FEEDBACK. If
he/she/it does not read feedback, an incantation may do the trick.
